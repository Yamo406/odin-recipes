  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>12 small chicken wings</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce</li>
  </ul>
  
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
      <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour
      mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
      into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>

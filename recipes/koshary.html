  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cup brown lentils, picked over and well-rinsed</li>
    <li>1 ½ cup medium-grain rice, rinsed, soaked in water for 15 minutes, drained</li>
    <li>½ tsp each salt and pepper</li>
    <li>½ tsp coriander</li>
    <li>2 cups elbow pasta</li>
    <li>Cooking oil</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and warmed</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the
  heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt.
  (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite
  to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).</li>
  <li>Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan
  over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring
  regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 ½ inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of
  water here). Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed
  and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or
  so.</li>
  <li>Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding
  the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain.</li>
  <li>Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.</li>
